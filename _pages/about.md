## About this Site

This site simply captures my bookmarks.  That's it, you probably don't care. There might be other stuff sprinkled around, but that's it.

### Minutia

For hosting I leverage [GitHub Pages and Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/), 
and use a somewhat tweaked version of the 
[minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme, with a dark color palette.

If you'd like to see _what_ I've tweaked, you can always 
[fork the repo](https://github.com/jamiesmith/grandelatte).

Some handy documents for the theme:

- [Quick-Start Guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
- [Sample Pages](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/year-archive/)
