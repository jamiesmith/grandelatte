## About this Site

This site simply captures my bookmarks.  That's it, you probably don't care. There might be other stuff sprinkled around, but that's it.

### Minutia

For hosting I leverage [GitHub Pages and Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/), 
and use a somewhat tweaked version of the 
[minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme, with a dark color palette.

If you'd like to see _what_ I've tweaked, you can always 
[fork the repo](https://github.com/jamiesmith/jamiesmith).

Some handy documents for the theme:

- [Quick-Start Guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
- [Sample Pages](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/year-archive/)


## About Jamie

I guess that no personal blog site would be complete without a completely
self-serving section on the author.  I know that you have been waiting, so
__here it is__!

Hi, my name is Jamie Smith.  I have a long history in software consulting.
Somewhere along the line the powers-that-be realized that I was good in front of
a whiteboard, and I was moved into a presales role, where I really started to
shine.  I honed my communication and other talents.  One of my greatest skills
is what I call *the art of efficiency*.  This isn't some self-help book with 47
steps to greatness-- more along the lines of
*enhanced laziness*. With this process I get things done as efficiently as
humanly possible.  Do something once?  OK, fine.  Twice?  Take notes and make it
repeatable.  Three or more times?  Write a script.

This ethos really seeps its way into all aspects of work - I plan to capture
some of the notes into docs for this site, hoping that someone will get some use
out of them.  Worst case, I reclaim a few KB on my Dropbox account.

I have a pretty broad experience base, ranging from credit card processing on
distributed transactional platforms to container management, Docker, and IoT. In
my previous roles I *lived* working with customers, pre and post sales. Whether
it was giving demos, standing at the whiteboard, or brainstorming around a
conference table or computer screen.  Case in point: I spent three months in
Singapore, working on a proof-of-concept project for a large consumer bank.
During that period we allocated at least two hours each day to spend with the
customer - designing their architecture, deciding and defending ideas.  Coming
to consensus with their team.  I was helping the customer learn the product,
while mentoring our new team learn at the same time. *This* is what I do.  My
time in Singapore was both glorious and dreadful. Meet me for a beer and I will
tell you the stories (but not Hoegaarden.  That was about the only decent beer
available in Singapore.  Three months.  Do the math. I will likely never drink
another Hoegaarden).

Now enablement is my primary focus.  My current gig was a big departure from
what I had been doing at previous companies, while keeping the best parts.  This
role has allowed me to develop and hone the abilities that were always an
undercurrent in my previous roles - conveying information and ideas.  Part of a
team, yet completely autonomous.  Demos, videos, slides, voiceovers (I have been 
told that I really have a face for radio, which I think is a compliment?).

Next to my laziness, another selling point is that I ~~am incredibly picky and
notice every mistake I see (except my own)~~ pay attention to the details of
things.  A good friend summed it up with "you see the world differently than
everyone else".

I am good with that.
